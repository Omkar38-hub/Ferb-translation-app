Convert Engish to Ferb Latin.
During their routine summer fun,
the two brothers Phineas and Ferb(in a Dinsney series) create their own language,
Ferb Latin which quickly catches on. Well,
if by that you mean we should create a whole new form of communication, then I couldn't agree more!' - Phineas Flynn
